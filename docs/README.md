# Project Plan

This document outlines the initial plan for the **NewsConsumer** web application. As development progresses, this file will be updated with design decisions and implementation notes.

## Goals
- Build an Angular application that fetches and displays news articles.
- Provide simple navigation between a list of articles, a detailed view, and an about page.
- Keep the user interface clear and minimal while remaining responsive.

## Initial Structure
```
src/
  app/
    components/
    services/
  environments/
docs/
  README.md
```

The `src` folder will contain the Angular project, organized by components and services. The `docs` folder stores documentation like this project plan.

## API Keys
API tokens live in the Angular `environment` files. Development and production
values are provided for **The News API**.

## Next Steps
1. Set up the Angular project scaffold.
2. Implement routing for the Home, About, and Article Details pages. **(done)**
3. Integrate a news API service to fetch articles.
4. Create components for the list and detail views.
5. Style the application for a clean user experience.
